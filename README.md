# Fantuan App Analysis and Redesign

## Project Overview

This project involves redesigning the Fantuan delivery platform to improve user experience using a human-centred design approach. The project was completed in 3 phases:

1. Understand – Perform a Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) to study users, their goals, and key system functions.

2. Create – Develop and compare design alternatives, then build a low-fidelity prototype applying usability and design principles.

3. Evaluate – Conduct a usability study with target users to test the prototype, collect data, and identify usability problems.

Each phase builds on the previous one, combining human factors methods with teamwork and communication skills.

**In the end...**
After identifying key usability issues in the original Fantuan app, a wireframe prototype was created using Figma and evaluated by University of Toronto students to determine the usability issues in the developed prototype.
